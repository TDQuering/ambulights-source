# AmbuLights

This is the source code for Team Datanooga's 2020 Smart City Project, AmbuLights.

## Branches

There are two main branches in this repository, the master branch and the development branch. The master branch contains the latest stable prototype of our software, which *should* work properly. The development branch contains whatever progress we've worked on most recently. No guarantees of stability, features, or even being able to run the code on the development branch.

## Dependencies

Our project uses many of python's builtin libraries. It specifically uses `time`, `datetime`, `threading`, `queue`, `random`, and `enum`. It also uses `graphics.py`, an open-source graphics library created by John Zelle, so special thanks to him for providing such a useful piece of software for free. You can find it [here](https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py) if you're interested.

## This Version

This is a __development__ version.
Status: __Working.__ This version of the code will run. However, the Route feature which we are in the middle of implementing currently does nothing.
